# Portfolio - Personal

## Description

This web page will serve as my work-in-progress portfolio. As I complete projects and other homework assignments I can update my work section with screenshots and working links to the deployed project. As well as update the functionality and usability of the web page itself. I think in the future adding a submission form in the contact me section for people to get ahold of me would be very useful.
